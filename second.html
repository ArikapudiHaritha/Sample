        <h2><b>FLU SHOT: </b></h2><h3>Influenza vaccines, also known as flu shots or flu jabs, are vaccines 
            that protect against infection by influenza virus. A new version of the vaccine is 
            developed twice a year as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness 
            varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. 
            They decrease the number of missed days of work by a half day on average.
            Vaccinating children may protect those around them.
            The effectiveness in those under two years old and over 65 years old is 
            unknown due to the low quality of the research.</h3><br>
            <h2><b>HIV test: </b></h2>
            <h3>HIV tests are used to detect the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
                the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),
                in serum, saliva, or urine. Such tests may detect antibodies, antigens, or RNA.</h3>
            <h2><b>Complete Blood Count: </b></h2>
            <h3>A complete blood count (CBC), also known as a complete blood cell count
                , full blood count (FBC), or full blood exam (FBE), 
                is a blood panel requested by a doctor or other medical professional
                that gives information about the cells in a patient's blood, such as the cell
                count for each cell type and the concentrations of various proteins and minerals.
                A scientist or lab technician performs the requested testing and provides the
                requesting medical professional with the results of the CBC.</h3>
